# Structure Notes
- This file will focus on the mechanical structure research for the production of Eragon

## Bipedal
- A form of terrestrial locomotion where an animal moves by means of its two rear legs
    - Raises the head
    - Greater field of vision
    - Allows non-locomotory limbs to be free for other uses.
- Types of Movement
    - Standing
    - Walking
    - Running
    - Jumping
    - Skipping

### Center of Mass
- Point where the body's mass is concentrated

### Base of Support
- Area defined by the feet on the ground

### Pivot point (aka Fulcrum)
- A specific location where a force causes rotation without the point itself moving. 
    - $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$
    

### Torque $T$
- Rotational equivalent of linear force. 
    - Quantification of the tendency of a force to cause or change the rotational motion of an object around a pivot point or axis

## Balance
- Countering gravitational forces, managing center-of-mass (CoM) and responding to perturbations in real-time

#### Static Balance
- Net forces and torques are zero
